# W207 Applied Machine Learning - Final Project
### Team Members - Alyssa Augsburger, Laura Herman, Emma Tebbe, Yixun Zhang

This project seeks to assist a digital asset management company with organizing their customers' assets. The goal was to be able to identify files that contain images of logos from files that do not contain logo images.
The team tried several different machine learning algorithms to accomplish this. They used logistic regression, single and multi-layer neural nets.
They were able to achieve an accuracy of 87% with a logistic regression model.
